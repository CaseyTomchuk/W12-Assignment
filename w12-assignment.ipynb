    "Use polynomial regression to model the nonlinear relationship between temperature and ice cream sales, and determine the optimal polynomial degree.\n",

    "## Dataset\n",
    "You have been provided with a dataset (`assignment2_icecream.csv`) containing:\n",
    "- **Temperature**: Daily temperature in Fahrenheit (30-100°F)\n",
    "- **Sales**: Ice cream sales in thousands of dollars\n",
    "\n",
    "## Background\n",
    "Not all relationships are linear! When a scatter plot shows a curved pattern, polynomial regression can capture that nonlinear relationship. In this assignment, you'll:\n",
    "1. Explore why linear regression might not be sufficient\n",
    "2. Fit polynomial models of different degrees\n",
